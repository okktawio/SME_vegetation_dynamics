Vegetation dynamics with particle filter

Starting with the code of the study:

Bruzzone, O. A., Perri, D. V., & Easdale, M. H. (2023). Vegetation responses to variations in climate: A combined ordinary differential equation and sequential Monte Carlo estimation approach. Ecological Informatics, 73, 101913.

we are going to develop a general model of plant population dynamics to be used with NDVI/EVI time series and climate data.
